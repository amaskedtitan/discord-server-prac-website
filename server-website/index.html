        <p><span class="first-character sc">H</span>induism, major world religion originating on the Indian subcontinent and comprising several and varied systems of philosophy, belief, and ritual. Although the name Hinduism is relatively new, having been coined by British writers in the first decades of the 19th century, it refers to a rich cumulative tradition of texts and practices, some of which date to the 2nd millennium bce or possibly earlier. If the Indus valley civilization (3rd–2nd millennium bce) was the earliest source of these traditions, as some scholars hold, then Hinduism is the oldest living religion on Earth. Its many sacred texts in Sanskrit and vernacular languages served as a vehicle for spreading the religion to other parts of the world, though ritual and the visual and performing arts also played a significant role in its transmission. From about the 4th century ce, Hinduism had a dominant presence in Southeast Asia, one that would last for more than 1,000 years.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">More strikingly than any other major religious community, Hindus accept—and indeed celebrate—the organic, multileveled, and sometimes pluralistic nature of their traditions. This expansiveness is made possible by the widely shared Hindu view that truth or reality cannot be encapsulated in any creedal formulation, a perspective expressed in the Hindu prayer “May good thoughts come to us from all sides.” Thus, Hinduism maintains that truth must be sought in multiple sources, not dogmatically proclaimed.</p>

      <div class="block">
        <p><span class="first-character ny">O</span>ur motive is to spread the hindu culture and religion.. To spread  The moral and spiritual teachings of Hinduism which are  widely appealing because they offered direct contact with the gods, often in exuberant rituals, and guidance for everyday life.  We provide the individual with a moral compass to guide virtue and piety. Hinduism believes that when individuals become better human beings, the society does so automatically. If all individuals play their parts sincerely as per their ‘dharma’ and perform their sacred duties, the society, and in larger context the humanity, will prosper to make the world a better place to live</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">Unlike other religions, origins of Hinduism are not limited to any one event or one prophet or a group of prophets. It has evolved with time and continues to do so even today. That is why Hinduism is seen more as a way of life than a religion. In line with this philosophy Hinduism focuses first and foremost on the individual. It allows every individual to find his or her own path towards the ultimate aim of being one with the divine. Following one’s ‘dharma’, which leads to spiritual advancement, is considered as acting in the service of humanity and in turn that of God. Each individual has his or her own ‘dharma’ since what is right for one may not necessarily be right for the other.</p>

        <p><span class="first-character atw">W</span>e chose discord as our main medium of infuence so we can gather a large bunch of people who dont know about the religion and can come with us and cose the way of eternal peace.. Discord is a platform full of non-hindu users so there are high chances to influence there easily ... We could have rather chosed twitter , instagram , facebook etc but they all ar ejust like showcases , Discord is a real community based platform for us to influence the reliogion already... <br> We are not only the one to influence the reliogion on discord , there are many server already  and we are growing together as a power full community.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">One of the drawbacks of influencing on Discord is that , Discord doesnt allow such type of religion/gender/caste etc , As already a sum of servers have been termed and never came back.. But we are carefull about that as we don't do  anything like raid on opposition religion server so that we dont get any reports about our server..    </p>
